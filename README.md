# Git Auto Commit

WARN: This project is work-in-progress.

This is a small utility that makes Git commits if specified files have changed.

I have various cron jobs that do background changes in Git repositories
(package lock files, marks, etc.). This plugin helps automatically commit them.

This project is also an opportunity to use Rust.
